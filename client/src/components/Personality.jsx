            Personality tests are crucial for career decision-making as they
            provide self-awareness, help match individuals with compatible
            professions, reduce career mismatches and dissatisfaction, guide
            skill development, improve interpersonal skills, and inform
            long-term career growth strategies. These assessments empower
            individuals to align their unique traits with suitable career paths,
            increasing the likelihood of career satisfaction and success.
